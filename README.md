A basic web monitor using python. The main goal here was to monitor AIUB's notice page for changes(new notices).It sends the user email when it detects a new notice on the web. It checks for new notices every 60seconds.
The user needs to use two different gmail accounts to send and recieve mails (as it uses gmail smtp)
make sure to edit the .env file as needed 
make sure to use 2fa for sending email and turn on separate generated "Mail" password
